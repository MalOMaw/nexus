# pwd
An application that is able to run multiple discord bots at the time each with their own character prompt. This can be used for roleplay or just chatting depending on the system prompt. 
For text generation, Large Language Models are used. Currently, only text-davinci-003 from openai api is supported. But llama/alpaca support is just a matter of time, as long as turbo3-5.

# How Do I Run This O_O

1. Make sure in the characters/ folder are only the characters you want to set up. Keep in mind you will need a discord bot token for each one
2. Open bot_tokens.py and add your token in the dictionary using the same name that is used for json of your character
3. Grab your openai api key and plug it into api_keys.py
4. Run bot_nexus_run.py
5. ???
6. Profit! (Probably does not work, go ahead ask me why)
